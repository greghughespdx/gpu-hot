## Usage

Monitor a single machine or an entire cluster with the same Docker image.

**Single machine:**
```bash
docker run -d --gpus all -p 1312:1312 ghcr.io/psalias2006/gpu-hot:latest
```

**Multiple machines:**
```bash
# On each GPU server
docker run -d --gpus all -p 1312:1312 -e NODE_NAME=$(hostname) ghcr.io/psalias2006/gpu-hot:latest

# On a hub machine (no GPU required)
docker run -d -p 1312:1312 -e GPU_HOT_MODE=hub -e NODE_URLS=http://server1:1312,http://server2:1312,http://server3:1312 ghcr.io/psalias2006/gpu-hot:latest
```

Open `http://localhost:1312`

**Older GPUs:** Add `-e NVIDIA_SMI=true` if metrics don't appear.

**Process monitoring:** Add `--init --pid=host` to see process names. Note: This allows the container to access host process information.

### NVIDIA, AMD, and hub nodes

The normal `docker-compose.yml` and `docker run --gpus all` commands use the
NVIDIA Container Toolkit and preserve the NVIDIA NVML and nvidia-smi paths.

For an AMD host, the same application image can use the standalone compose
file. It reads required metrics from amdgpu sysfs and hwmon, so ROCm and
amd-smi are not required:

```bash
NODE_NAME=$(hostname) \
docker compose -f docker-compose.amd.yml up --build -d
```

This base AMD path is sysfs-only. It does not require ROCm, `amd-smi`,
`/dev/dri`, or `/dev/kfd`. The compose default is `gpu-hot-node` when
`NODE_NAME` is not set, and `NODE_NAME=$(hostname)` gives the host name.

To opt in to AMD process and throttle enrichment, use the separate override.
It mounts the host ROCm runtime read-only and adds only the device access needed
by `amd-smi`:

```bash
NODE_NAME=$(hostname) \
ROCM_HOST_PATH=/opt/rocm/core-7.14 \
docker compose -f docker-compose.amd.yml -f docker-compose.amd-smi.yml up --build -d
```

Set `ROCM_HOST_PATH` to the host directory that contains `bin/amd-smi` and
`lib`. On the tested ROCm host, the path is `/opt/rocm/core-7.14`, so the
container runs `/opt/rocm/core-7.14/bin/amd-smi` from the read-only mount.
Process discovery also needs `SYS_PTRACE` and an unconfined AppArmor profile,
which the override applies to this container. Together with host PID mode,
these settings let `amd-smi` inspect host GPU process names and memory use. Use
the enrichment override only on a trusted host. The core sysfs metrics continue
to work if the optional command is unavailable.

For a hub node with no GPU, use the existing hub command with
`GPU_HOT_MODE=hub` and `NODE_URLS` as shown below. AMD devices use the same
bare numeric GPU indices and payload shape as NVIDIA devices. The `vendor`
field identifies which collector produced each record.

**From source:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/psalias2006/gpu-hot
cd gpu-hot
docker-compose up --build
```

**Requirements:** Docker + [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)

## Features

- Real-time metrics (sub-second)
- Automatic multi-GPU detection
- Process monitoring (PID, memory usage)
- Historical charts (utilization, temperature, power, clocks)
- System metrics (CPU, RAM)
- Scale from 1 to 100+ GPUs

**Metrics:** Utilization, temperature, memory, power draw, fan speed and RPM, clock speeds, PCIe info, P-State, throttle status, encoder/decoder sessions

---

## Configuration

**Environment variables:**
```bash
NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1     # Specific GPUs (default: all)
NVIDIA_SMI=true                # Force nvidia-smi mode for older GPUs
GPU_HOT_MODE=hub               # Set to 'hub' for multi-node aggregation (default: single node)
NODE_NAME=gpu-server-1         # Node display name (default: hostname)
NODE_URLS=http://host:1312...  # Comma-separated node URLs (required for hub mode)
UPDATE_INTERVAL=0.5            # Optional. NVML polling interval in seconds (default: 0.5)
NVIDIA_SMI_INTERVAL=2.0        # Optional. nvidia-smi fallback polling interval (default: 2.0)
EXTERNAL_FANS={...}            # Optional. Fan channels for passive cards (default: off, see below)
```

Single-node polling pauses when no clients are connected. Hub mode keeps its node
connections active so its health check can verify that node data remains fresh.

**Backend (`core/config.py`):**
```python
PORT = 1312            # Server port
```

### External fans for passive cards

A passive server card has no fan of its own and so reports no fan speed. The
fan that actually cools it sits on a chassis or duct controller, which Linux
exposes through hwmon. `EXTERNAL_FANS` maps a GPU's PCI address to one of
those channels so the dashboard shows the fan that is doing the work.

It is off unless set, and it applies to any vendor: an AMD card with no fan
node and an NVIDIA card whose driver reports no fan are both covered, because
the mapping is keyed by PCI address and applied after the vendor collector.

The value is a JSON object of PCI address to fan source:

```bash
EXTERNAL_FANS='{
  "0000:19:00.0": {"source": "hwmon", "name": "arctic_fan", "channel": 1},
  "0000:67:00.0": {"source": "hwmon", "name": "arctic_fan", "channel": 2}
}'
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `source` | `hwmon` (the default, and the only kind today) |
| `name` | hwmon device name, matched against `/sys/class/hwmon/*/name`. Preferred: hwmon numbers are not stable across boots |
| `path` | An hwmon directory, if you would rather name it directly. An entry gives `name` or `path`, never both, and is rejected with a log line if it gives both |
| `channel` | The channel number `N` in that device's `fanN_input` and `pwmN` |
| `override` | `true` to use the mapping even when the card reports its own fan. Defaults to `false` |

`pwmN` becomes `fan_speed` as a percentage of the kernel's 0 to 255 range, and
`fanN_input` becomes `fan_rpm`, shown under the fan reading on the GPU card.
Either is omitted if its file is missing, so a controller with no tachometer
still reports a speed. A missing or unreadable file never interrupts
collection. A malformed entry is skipped with a log line and the rest of the
mapping still loads.

hwmon names are not guaranteed to be unique. If two devices answer to the same
`name`, the entry reports nothing at all rather than guess which one cools the
card, and says so once in the log; give that entry an explicit `path` instead.

These are a few small, bounded sysfs reads per mapped card per poll, and they
run on the event loop rather than in a thread. On a normal `/sys` that is
microseconds, but it is synchronous work on the loop, so a host whose sysfs
reads block would feel it.

Find the device name and its channels with:

```bash
grep . /sys/class/hwmon/*/name
grep . /sys/class/hwmon/hwmonN/fan*_input /sys/class/hwmon/hwmonN/pwm*
```

and the PCI address of each card with `ls -l /sys/class/drm/card*/device`.

No extra container configuration is needed: Docker already mounts the host's
`/sys` read-only, so `/sys/class/hwmon` is visible inside the container.

const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:1312/socket.io/');

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  // data.gpus      — per-GPU metrics
  // data.processes  — active GPU processes

## Troubleshooting

**No GPUs detected:**
```bash
nvidia-smi  # Verify drivers work
docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:12.1.0-base-ubuntu22.04 nvidia-smi  # Test Docker GPU access
```

**Hub can't connect to nodes:**
```bash
curl http://node-ip:1312/api/gpu-data  # Test connectivity
sudo ufw allow 1312/tcp                # Check firewall
```

**Performance issues:** Increase `UPDATE_INTERVAL` (env var, seconds — e.g. `-e UPDATE_INTERVAL=2.0`)
